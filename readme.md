# Three.js 3D Model Viewer

This project is a 3D model viewer built using Three.js, featuring HDRI lighting and user controls for interactive exploration of a 3D model.

## Features

- Render a 3D model using WebGL
- Add HDRI background and environment lighting
- User-friendly controls for rotating, zooming, and panning the view
- Responsive design that adjusts to window resizing

## Technologies Used

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) - A JavaScript library for 3D graphics
- [OrbitControls](https://threejs.org/examples/#misc_controls_orbit) - Controls for orbiting around a target
- [RGBELoader](https://threejs.org/examples/#misc_rgbel) - Loader for HDRI environments
- [GLTFLoader](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/loaders/GLTFLoader) - Loader for GLTF 3D models

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Open the `index.html` file in your browser:**

   You can serve the project using a local server, or simply open the HTML file directly.

## Usage

- Adjust your view using the mouse:
  - Left-click and drag to rotate.
  - Scroll to zoom in and out.
  - Right-click and drag to pan the view.

## Example Model

The project loads a Tesla model in GLB format (`tesla.glb`). Ensure that this file is in the same directory as the HTML file.
